shasha clarified the following rules regarding the input:
- no two transactions will have the same age
- per timepoint, at most one operation per transaction
- no conflicts in concurrent operations
- when a transaction is waiting (due to locks or sites being down),
	it will not receive another operation
- there will be no other command on a line that has a fail (or a recover)
